# Operation: Falcon Nation

ðŸ¦… "Operation: Falcon Nation" is a complete re-imagining of a classic board game through the magnification of scale, sensory experience, and of course, automation. Featuring a 6-ft, life-size board, dramatically upscaled themed pieces, and technology-enhanced automation  of game mechanics, the project was built to serve philanthropic causes and events.
